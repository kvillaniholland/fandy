# js-utils
A set of JavaScript utility functions I find myself needing frequently.

None of these are functions you can't find elsewhere, but I often find myself needing some of these, and not wanting to add a large dependency like lodash to my project.

This project is also a chance for me to practice setting up CI, full test coverage and a real README for the first time.

Feel free to make pull requests.
